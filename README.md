- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Node (JavaScript runtime)
- NPM
- Yarn
- React
- React Native

1.  Install Expo, by pasting the following to the terminal. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to run the command:  

      ```shell
      npm install --global expo-cli
      ```

1. Initialize a expo project:

      expo init my-project
      ```

   Choose `black` as your template when prompted (it should be the default option).

1. Start your app in your browser:

      ```shell
      yarn web
      ```

1. Publish your repository
   - Open the command palette
   - Use the command `Publish to GitHub`
   - Confirm the repo name and choose if you want to have it public or private
   - It is now hosted on your GitHub!
